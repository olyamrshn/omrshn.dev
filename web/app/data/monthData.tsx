          was a brilliant idea. a similar app has already been made for New
          York, but we planned to make it on a larger scale. maybe we'll get
          lucky later. april's packed with work. bouncing between
          istanbul-tbilisi for papers, grinding through residency stuff. found a
          kitten in georgia - had him for four days before he slipped away.
          someone else took him from the street.

          feel exhausted from this period. don't think i have ever changed
          cities so frequently - Petersburg, Moscow, train to Kaluga for Signal
          fest, back to Moscow, train to Kazan, flight back to Saint P. Home,
          cottage, sleeping in a cold tent with bugs, hostels and hotels. really
          enjoyed the festival, met a lot of cool people. had laptop detox for 4
          days!!! music only started late in the evening, with lectures and
          walks with coffee during the day. sank into a deep depression this
          month. The sugar mommy role is definitely not for me, and I hate
          taking 100% responsibility. also felt crappy in Kazan at the nix
          sprint where there were no other women, and guys told me I couldnt
          stay at their house, so I had to find an overpriced hostel because all
          the hotels were unreasonably expensive. btw, my place turned out to be
          nice and right in the center, so I often walked to the park by black
          lake and had lovely girl roommates. so glad im heading home to saint p
          soon.

        "just wondering when i'll finally spend a month in one place. but changing locations in europe brings me much more joy than it did in russia. so much has happened, and i regret my procrastination in writing these diary entries with such delay. in the first days, i registered my residence in northern spain + applied for a job at an IT company and now waiting for approval from spanish government üá™üá∏ this could take about month or something. just three hours by car from cantabria and there's biarritz - a city where a surfboard is mounted in church. im absolutely amazed + want to come back here in summer for surfing and helado. on the way back, i devoured best basque cheesecake in san sebastian - mashallah, everything id tasted before pales in comparison to this flavor and texture. ofc the most memorable was paris, where my share of the 500 euro winnings in ton hackhathon immediately went towards paying for work insurance üòç time was quite limited and i barely managed to properly explore the city. however, i discovered new neighborhoods and stocked up on clothes, especially cos jeans and ballerinas in cool vintage store in the same building as the apartments. last time i wanted to visit pompidou to see the cy twombly temporary exhibition, but due to the shooting the museum was closed that day, and this time i finally made it there with friends after queuing in the rain! i was the only one who had to pay for entry as a non-eu citizen) also, tried bouldering for the first time. im spending the rest of my time at house on cantabrian mountain (even now as im writing this note) with my thoughts and laptop. for several nights in a row, someone has been stealing chickens. it seems my freelance employer with jewelry website has abandoned me, so this will just end up being a portfolio project. thats fine, not a big deal. days here pass like years, my max on the steps app is 2 km per day but my weight remains stable, which makes me kinda happy. trying to do core exercises and get some running while walking corgi doggo.",

          complex until the end of january. highly recommend this place, but the
          hour-long metro ride to downtown is a bit much... trying to convince
          my partner to move closer to the city center (especially salamanca or
          chamberi, interestingly, coffee is much cheaper there), though i'll
          miss having our gym upstairs - just started getting into running with
          the treadmill. the vibe of spanish cities reminds me a bit of
          istanbul, but cleaner. im amazed by how everything is put together in
          that european way, from how people dress to the cafe and store
          windows. these are usually simple pieces with interesting details. I
          moved here with just the bare essentials, and now my wardrobe consists
          of cos and massimo dutti clothes. recently discovered cute store
          Brandy Melville with really nice cotton basics (wanna buy entire
          collection). to be honest, madrid has one disadvantage: i've gotten
          used to living in cities with waterfront views since its always the
          best spot for a walk. there's nothing like that here, and i miss it so
          much.
